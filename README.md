ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Engr. Yeoj! A Mechatronics Engineer with a passion in Artificial Intelligence.
I used to specialize in hardware development and embedded systems such as with microcontrollers and other electronic circuitry.
However, as time passes by, I found myself in love with Artificial Intelligence and Data Science in general. I have been upskilling
in the past few months while I work as an IOT Engineer for a private startup. 
I have expertise in the following:
1. Computer Programming - C/C++, Visual Basic, Python
2. Data Analytics - Data Pre-processing, Data Visualization, Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Data Science - Machine Learning, Machine Vision
4. Internet of Things - Arduino/ESP, Sensors, SQL, Firebase, etc.
5. Robotics - Wireless Control, 3D Printing, Mechanical Systems

This repository will be where I put my relevant projects that showcase my skills!
